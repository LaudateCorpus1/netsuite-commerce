This is a repository of code samples for NetSuite SuiteCommerce and SuiteCommerce Advanced. The snippets show how the code works; they are not official features or modules for SuiteCommerce.

## Dependencies

In order to use these samples and develop a web store you will need at a minimum:
* An active NetSuite account
* An installed SuiteCommerce or SuiteCommerce Advanced (Denali or newer) bundle and their associated bundles
* The [developer tools](https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=preface_1519250632.html) installed on your machine

Furthermore, it is recommended that you have:
* Read the official documentation, in particular the [developer overview](http://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=chapter_N2655313.html) sections
* Completed the [SuiteCommerce: Web Store Administration training](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/services/training/suite-training/description-web-store-administration.shtml)
* Completed the [SuiteCommerce: Theme and Extension Development training](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/services/training/suite-training/description-suitecommerce-theme-and-extension-development.shtml) (if your web store uses SuiteCommerce or SuiteCommerce Advanced Aconcagua (2018.1) or newer)

## Organization of the Repository

This repository contains code samples (in the directory called **samples**) split up by version. The version indicates roughly when the code was written, but given the flexibility of the code, some of it will be backwards-compatible, and some will be forwards-compatible.

The code samples are there to show you things fit together and to give you ideas about customizations that you can make to SuiteCommerce and SuiteCommerce Advanced web stores. They are not 'official' NetSuite features --- you should consider them learning materials to improve your understanding of the products.

## Installation

There is no installation required for these code samples.

Some users may prefer to use GitHub to browse the code samples; others may wish to clone the repository to their local machine.

## Documentation

No official documentation for NetSuite products are hosted in this repository --- that is available in the Help Center via your NetSuite account, or [SuiteAnswers](https://netsuite.custhelp.com/app/home).

Primary documentation for these code samples come in the form of comments in the source files. However, you should also search the [developer portal](https://developers.suitecommerce.com) as you will likely find an accompanying article that explains the code (and the process for writing it) in more detail.
