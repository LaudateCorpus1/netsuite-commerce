This is a repository of code samples for NetSuite SuiteCommerce and SuiteCommerce Advanced, as well as a developer site providing additional information on how to develop on these products. The snippets show how the code works; they are not official features or modules for SuiteCommerce.

## Dependencies

In order to use these samples and develop a web store you will need at a minimum:
* An active NetSuite account
* An installed SuiteCommerce or SuiteCommerce Advanced (Denali or newer) bundle and their associated bundles
* The [developer tools](https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=preface_1519250632.html) installed on your machine

Furthermore, it is recommended that you have:
* Read the official documentation, in particular the [developer overview](http://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=chapter_N2655313.html) sections
* Completed the [SuiteCommerce: Web Store Administration training](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/services/training/suite-training/description-web-store-administration.shtml)
* Completed the [SuiteCommerce: Theme and Extension Development training](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/services/training/suite-training/description-suitecommerce-theme-and-extension-development.shtml) (if your web store uses SuiteCommerce or SuiteCommerce Advanced Aconcagua (2018.1) or newer)

## Organization of the Repository

The repository contains code for operating a page on GitHub Pages and sample code.

If you clone the repository to your machine, you will be able to run the site locally using Jekyll. However, we would recommend using the up-to-date live version on [developers.suitecommerce.com](https://developers.suitecommerce.com).

This repository also contains code samples (in the directory called **samples**) split up by version. The version indicates roughly when the code was written, but given the flexibility of the code, some of it will be backwards-compatible, and some will be forwards-compatible.

The code samples are there to show you things fit together; it is not advisable to simply copy and paste entire modules into your live site without first examining and experimenting with the code.

## Installation

You can clone the repository if you wish. You will, however, be downloading a lot of code which may not be relevant to your site. It is recommended, instead, that you browse/search for either the version of your site for interesting nuggets, or, instead, the browse around for a potential feature or search for a keyword you might be interested in.

## Documentation

No official documentation for NetSuite products are hosted in this repository. The content on this site comes in two forms:

1. Code samples that demonstrate best practices, teach how the architecture works, provide ideas for custom functionality, tutorialize basic concepts, etc
2. Written content to supplement this code

Accordingly, you are encouraged to refer to official NetSuite documentation, which is available in the Help Center via your NetSuite account, or SuiteAnswers ([https://netsuite.custhelp.com/app/home](https://netsuite.custhelp.com/app/home)).

## Support

No support is provided for these code samples, they are provided as-is.

## Contributions

This repository is to help developers get started and work on customizations for SuiteCommerce and SuiteCommerce Advanced. Do **not** raise issues to ask general questions about SuiteCommerce, or to report bugs with the bundles or NetSuite. Issues must relate only to the content within this repository.

Pull requests are currently not being accepted for the NetSuite SuiteCommerce Developers project.

If you have ideas, comments, or issues to discuss, create an issue in this repository.
