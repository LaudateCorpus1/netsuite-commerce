        <p>Sorry, we couldn't find the page you were looking for.</p>
        <p>This is usually because of either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A mistyped address, or</li>
            <li>An out-of-date link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you typed the URL, check for spelling mistakes.</p>
        <p>If you tried to reach a product, use the search box to search for it.</p>
        <p>Finally, you can simply <a href="/">return to the homepage</a>.</p>
